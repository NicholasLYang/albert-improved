# Albert Impoved

This is a quick Chrome extension to make Albert slightly more
usable. It's basically scraping course info with a Ruby script, then
creating a Chrome extension that does some find and replaces in the
browser.

This is not meant to be a super long term project, just a quick
nice-to-have. However, here are a few goals:

- Make updating better. Right now the extension updates on click,
  which isn't ideal. A smarter updating strategy would go a long way.
  
- Add more courses. Right now there's only a few subjects, all from
  CAS. Ideally we'd have all the courses offered.
  
- Add more abbreviations. There's a few other abbreviations like
  buildings and just dumb Albert fuckery (Nbr -> Number, Prob ->
  Probability) that I'd like to fix.
